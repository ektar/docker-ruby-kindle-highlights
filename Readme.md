# Dockerized environment for Kindle Highlights

Didn't want to pollute my environment with ruby, encapsulated in docker...

To enter for development:
```
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/code:/code ektar/ruby /bin/bash
```

To execute:
```
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/code:/code ektar/ruby /bin/bash
```
